# COVID-19 Risk Prediction with Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict an individual's risk of contracting **COVID-19** based on real-world survey data. It demonstrates the use of data preprocessing, model development, and performance evaluation to support predictive analytics in a public health context.

## 📊 Project Goals
- Clean and preprocess COVID-19 survey data
- Perform feature selection and normalization
- Train and evaluate **Decision Tree** and **K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)** classifiers
- Interpret model results to identify influential risk factors

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Visual Outputs
- Correlation matrix for feature relationships
- Confusion matrices and classification metrics
- Accuracy comparison of different classification models

## 📁 Files
- `Covid19_MachineLearning_Project.ipynb`: Cleaned and annotated Jupyter notebook
- Dataset: `covid_survey.csv` (or a placeholder if dataset is not public)

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Age, contact frequency, and symptoms like loss of smell were key predictors
- Feature normalization was essential for KNN performance
- The Decision Tree model offered strong interpretability with competitive accuracy

## 🔄 Reproducibility
To run this project:
1. Clone the repository
2. Install requirements (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
3. Open `Covid19_MachineLearning_Project.ipynb` in Jupyter
4. Run all cells to replicate the analysis
